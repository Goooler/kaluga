/**
 * A [Locale] object represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region.
 * An operation that requires a Locale to perform its task is called locale-sensitive and uses the [Locale] to tailor information for the user.
 * For example, displaying a number is a locale-sensitive operationâ€” the number should be formatted according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country, region, or culture.
 *
 * The [Locale] class implements identifiers interchangeable with BCP 47 (IETF BCP 47, "Tags for Identifying Languages"), with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data exchange.
 *
 *  A [Locale] object logically consists of the fields described below.
 *
 * ### language ###
 *     ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
 *     When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the alpha-2 code must be used.
 *     You can find a full list of valid language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: language").
 *     The language field is case insensitive, but [Locale] always canonicalizes to lower case.
 *
 *     Well-formed language values have the form [a-zA-Z]{2,8}.
 *     Note that this is not the the full BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang.
 *     They are not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace them.
 *
 *     Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)
 *
 * ### country (region) ###
 *     ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
 *     You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region").
 *     The country (region) field is case insensitive, but [Locale] always canonicalizes to upper case.
 *
 *     Well-formed country/region values have the form [a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}
 *
 *     Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029" (Caribbean)
 *
 * ### variant ###
